<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
<p font-size= 0.5rem>ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a systems analyst, I provide support for the Totvs ERP - Protheus Line and I am familiar with the ADVPL language, which is used for Totvs programs.</p>
<p>ðŸŒ±I'm studying Software Development at BYU Idaho Online, I'm finalizing the requirements for my first certificate in Web and Computer Programming.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on ADVPL projects, or in the languages â€‹â€‹I've been learning such as C#, Python, SQL, among others.</p>
<p>ðŸ¤”I'm looking for help with javascript, this subject has been very challenging for me so far.</p>
<p>ðŸ“« How to contact me: email: ana.sabino.monteiro@gmail.com</p>
<p>ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She, Her</p>
<p>âš¡ Fun fact: I worked in the financial/accounting area for most of my professional life, but I always loved the technology area.</p>
<p>âš¡ I kind of accidentally managed to migrate to another area when I thought it was no longer possible, in 2018 and here I am in 2024 at 43 years old, learning something new every day!</p>
